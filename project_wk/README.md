# Technical Challenge for WK

# Overview
This project made using Django is a web application used to filter through countries using a case in-sensitive search bar. When a search term is inputted, the application checks the database for existing countries and displays the results. Each result includes the name of the country, its continent, and its population. If a country doesn't exist an error message is displayed instead. New countries can be added via the Django admin interface.
